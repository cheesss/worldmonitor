# Investment & Replay

## What it does

Connects live events to assets, produces decision-support objects, and validates them with replay and backtesting.

## Why it exists

To turn narrative monitoring into testable, reviewable decision workflows.

## Inputs

- events, themes, and transmission outputs
- market time series
- source and mapping priors
- historical replay frames

## Outputs

- investment idea cards
- sizing and false-positive guardrails
- replay and walk-forward run summaries
- backtest lab visuals and decision comparisons
- coverage-aware universe summary, review queue, and gap tracking
- approved dynamic candidates that join the next refresh and subsequent backtests
- universe policy modes for manual, guarded auto-approval, and full auto-approval
- scheduler-driven replay and nightly walk-forward when the automation worker is enabled
- theme discovery queue items that can become reusable backtest themes after Codex proposal and guarded promotion
- source registry candidates that can now auto-approve and auto-activate under guarded score and diversity policy
- coverage-gap candidate expansion that can now be requested by the scheduler instead of only by button clicks
- candidate auto-approval that now uses composite scoring plus sector and asset-kind caps
- weak theme motifs and low-signal autonomous keywords that can now be auto-retired or auto-rejected
- weak idea cards that can now be auto-suppressed before the operator view

## Key UI surfaces

- Investment Workflow
- Auto Investment Ideas
- Backtest Lab
- Transmission Sankey / Network
- Coverage-aware universe review queue

## Algorithms involved

- event-to-market transmission
- regime weighting
- Kalman-style adaptive weighting
- Hawkes intensity, transfer entropy, bandits
- historical replay and warm-up handling
- coverage-aware candidate retrieval
- deterministic ranking over core plus approved expansion assets
- Codex-assisted candidate expansion as a reviewed queue, not an execution path
- guarded auto-approval with probation and auto-demotion
- composite auto-approval scoring with source, role, supporting signals, and crowding penalties
- dataset registry plus scheduler worker for unattended replay cadence
- theme discovery queue built from repeated unmapped motifs in replay frames
- Codex theme proposer automation with guarded auto-promotion, novelty overlap limits, and promotion scores
- source automation sweep for discovered feed and API registry acceptance using score, health, and diversity caps
- scheduler-driven candidate expansion and replay refresh after accepted universe changes, with cooldown and per-region balancing
- autonomous keyword lifecycle review and theme-queue hygiene
- pre-render idea-card triage and suppression

## Limits

The public site documents the system behavior but not private operational data or sensitive market configurations.

## Variant coverage

Primary: `finance`. Extended and shared support also exists in `tech`.

# Investment Usage Playbook

This system is not an auto-trader. Use it as a structured decision-support terminal.

## What it is good at

- Detecting geopolitical, sanctions, supply-chain, cyber, and macro shocks early.
- Translating those shocks into candidate countries, sectors, commodities, ETFs, and symbols.
- Tracking whether those mappings have worked historically inside the system.
- Showing why an idea exists via evidence, transmission, ontology, and market context.

## What it is not good enough for yet

- Blind automated execution.
- Portfolio-level risk optimization across all positions.
- Full institutional walk-forward research without historical backfill.
- Perfect false-positive control.

## Daily operating workflow

1. Detect
   - Use `AI 인사이트`, `전략적 리스크 개요`, `Country Exposure Matrix`, `Signal Ridge`.
   - Goal: identify which theme is accelerating.

2. Validate
   - Check `Source credibility`, multi-source confirmation, and whether the story is archive/noise/sports contamination.
   - If evidence is thin, do not escalate to a trade candidate.

3. Map
   - Use `Event Impact Screener`, `Flow Sankey`, and `Auto Investment Ideas`.
   - Goal: convert event -> transmission path -> symbol/ETF/commodity candidate.

4. Size
   - Read conviction, false-positive risk, and suggested size.
   - Treat the system's size as a first-pass recommendation, not a final book allocation.

5. Monitor
   - Watch `Tracked Ideas`, live returns, realized returns, and invalidation conditions.
   - Close or downgrade ideas when the transmission path weakens or the evidence degrades.

6. Postmortem
   - Review which ideas worked, which failed, and which sources were wrong.
   - This is what improves posterior source scores and mapping stats over time.

## How to use specific panels

### Macro Investment Workflow

- Use this first.
- It structures the process as:
  - Detect
  - Validate
  - Map
  - Stress Test
  - Size
  - Monitor
- The workflow now also surfaces:
  - coverage-aware universe status
  - current theme/region coverage gaps
  - candidate expansion review queue
  - Codex-assisted candidate proposals
  - universe policy mode: `manual`, `guarded-auto`, `full-auto`
  - macro kill-switch and hedge overlay
  - explainable attribution for idea cards and direct mappings
  - self-tuning experiment history and active weight profile
  - dataset autonomy summary and guarded auto-registration proposals
  - hidden graph-discovered candidates that did not come from direct trigger keywords

### Coverage-aware universe and candidate expansion

- The engine now distinguishes between:
  - core universe assets
  - approved dynamic expansions
  - open review candidates
- Approved candidates do not hot-patch the current idea list immediately.
- They become active on the next intelligence refresh, then participate in:
  - direct event-to-asset mappings
  - idea cards
  - tracked ideas
  - replay / walk-forward backtests
- Default recommendation:
  - `guarded-auto`
  - Codex proposals now go through a composite auto-approval score, sector caps, and asset-kind caps
- `full-auto` exists, but it should be treated as an aggressive research mode rather than a default production mode
- Use the queue like this:
  1. Find a coverage gap.
  2. Review proposed candidates.
  3. Approve only liquid, understandable instruments.
  4. Re-run or wait for the next intelligence refresh.
  5. Check whether the new candidate actually improves backtest rows.

### Macro kill switch and hedge overlay

- Use this before treating any idea as deployable.
- Read:
  - macro state
  - risk gauge
  - top-down action
  - net and gross exposure caps
  - hedge bias list
  - kill-switch note
- Interpret it this way:
  - `risk-on`: directional ideas can still compete on their own merits
  - `balanced`: directional ideas are allowed, but sizing is capped
  - `risk-off`: non-hedge ideas should usually stay in `shadow`
  - `kill-switch`: net directional deployment should be treated as blocked

### Explainable attribution

- Use this when an idea looks attractive but you need to know why.
- The system now breaks the score into:
  - corroboration
  - contradiction and rumor penalties
  - graph-propagation support
  - regime and beta pressure
  - stale-prior decay
  - reality penalties such as spread, slippage, liquidity, and session state
  - macro overlay pressure
- If the breakdown is mostly penalties or generic beta, do not treat the idea as a differentiated event trade.

### Self-tuning experiments

- The active weight profile is no longer only a fixed heuristic bundle.
- The system now keeps an experiment registry that can:
  - observe candidate profiles
  - promote better profiles
  - roll back weak profiles
- Use this section to check:
  - whether the active profile was recently promoted
  - whether rollback is armed
  - whether recent replay improvements came from real signal or only from a more aggressive weight set

### Dataset autonomy

- The system can now propose missing historical datasets when live replay keeps surfacing the same uncovered theme pressure.
- This is guarded, not blind expansion.
- Treat dataset auto-registration as:
  - a way to widen historical coverage
  - not a guarantee that the new dataset is immediately useful
- After a new dataset registers:
  1. Wait for the scheduler to fetch and import it.
  2. Check whether replay and walk-forward actually improve.
  3. If not, keep the proposal observed rather than trusting it as permanent coverage.

### Hidden graph candidates

- These are asset candidates discovered through relationship propagation, not only direct keywords.
- Use them to inspect second-order and third-order transmission paths.
- Good use:
  - hidden suppliers
  - downstream customers
  - logistics chokepoint proxies
  - financing and hedge instruments
- Bad use:
  - deploying them just because they are novel

### Auto Investment Ideas

- Use this second.
- Read:
  - theme
  - direction
  - candidate symbols
  - conviction
  - false-positive risk
  - size
  - invalidation
- Good use: shortlist creation.
- Bad use: direct execution without review.

### Ontology

- Use this to verify whether the narrative actually hangs together.
- Good questions:
  - Which entities are really connected?
  - Is this an event node or just keyword noise?
  - Are sanctions / ownership / chokepoint relations valid?

### Scheduled Situation Reports

- Use these for top-down review.
- They are good for:
  - briefing
  - state snapshot comparison
  - replay checkpoints
- They are not a substitute for direct evidence review.

## Best practice for actual decisions

- Use the tool to narrow from 100 stories to 3 actionable themes.
- Then validate those 3 themes manually before committing risk.
- Focus on:
  - transmission path clarity
  - source quality
  - cross-asset confirmation
  - point-in-time price response

## Current limits you should respect

- Mapping stats improve only as closed ideas accumulate.
- Source posterior still uses proxy truth, not perfect ground-truth labeling.
- Historical walk-forward is implemented, but historical backfill/import is not complete yet.
- Dynamic universe coverage reduces blind spots, but it still cannot guarantee perfect asset-class coverage.
- Codex-assisted candidate expansion is a review loop, not an auto-execution path.
- Approved expansions only become live on the next refresh, so they should be treated as queued universe changes.
- Auto-approved candidates now run through a probation window and can be auto-demoted if they repeatedly fail to produce useful mappings.
- Source acceptance is now mostly automated under guarded policy, but it uses composite source scoring plus category/domain caps rather than raw confidence alone.
- Weak theme motifs and low-signal autonomous keywords are now auto-retired or auto-rejected by the unattended loop.
- Weak idea cards are now auto-suppressed before the operator view, so the dashboard no longer depends on manual cleanup of every low-quality card.
- The engine now applies cross-corroboration and contradiction penalties, so multi-source disagreement can reduce confidence even when the headline count looks strong.
- The engine now applies recency decay and recent-evidence floors, so old mapping wins cannot dominate current recommendations.
- The engine now applies constrained-autonomy actions:
  - `deploy`
  - `shadow`
  - `watch`
  - `abstain`
- The engine now applies execution-reality penalties:
  - spread
  - slippage
  - liquidity
  - session-state / closed-market risk
- Recent shadow-book weakness can now arm rollback and force the system into shadow mode until performance recovers.
- Macro overlay can now cap exposure or force non-hedge ideas out of `deploy` entirely.
- Explainable attribution can now show whether an idea was driven by corroborated event evidence, graph propagation, beta, or penalty-heavy noise.
- Dataset autonomy can widen the historical registry, but auto-registration is still guarded by cost, overlap, and replay-safety checks.
- Self-tuning can now change active weight profiles, but only through the experiment registry and rollback gate.

## Unattended automation loop

The backtest stack can now run without daily operator clicks, but only if you wire the scheduler correctly.

### What controls it

- dataset registry: `config/intelligence-datasets.json`
- scheduler script: `scripts/intelligence-scheduler.mjs`
- Windows runner: `scripts/run-intelligence-scheduler.ps1`
- Windows task installer: `scripts/install-intelligence-scheduler-task.ps1`
- automation service: `src/services/server/intelligence-automation.ts`
- theme discovery: `src/services/theme-discovery.ts`
- Codex theme proposer: `src/services/server/codex-theme-proposer.ts`

### What the scheduler does

1. Fetch enabled historical datasets
2. Import them into the bitemporal DuckDB archive
3. Run replay on cadence
4. Run nightly walk-forward
5. Refresh the theme discovery queue from replay frames
6. Ask Codex for new theme proposals only on high-signal queue items
7. Auto-promote only when guarded thresholds pass
8. Sweep discovered sources and API sources through source automation policy
9. Ask Codex for candidate expansion on top coverage gaps
10. Auto-accept only when universe thresholds pass, then replay again if the active universe changed
11. Review keyword lifecycle and retire low-signal autonomous keywords
12. Ask Codex for dataset proposals on repeated uncovered theme pressure, then guard-register only replay-safe datasets
13. Run self-tuning over recent replay and walk-forward outcomes, then promote or roll back weight profiles through the experiment registry
14. Auto-clean weak theme queue items and suppress weak idea cards before the operator view
15. Apply constrained-autonomy gates so weak, stale, contradictory, or low-executability ideas are downgraded to `shadow`, `watch`, or `abstain`
16. Apply macro kill-switch and hedge overlay so top-down collapse can override attractive micro themes
17. Keep shadow-book rollback armed until recent tracked performance recovers

### What Codex does and does not do

- Codex can now propose new backtest themes from repeated unmapped motifs.
- Codex can also propose additional symbols for coverage gaps after replay.
- Codex can also propose new historical datasets when repeated theme pressure is visible but the current replay registry is too narrow.
- Codex does not blindly decide trades or override the scheduler policy.
- In `guarded-auto`, deterministic thresholds still gate promotion:
  - promotion score
  - discovery score
  - sample count
  - source diversity
  - Codex confidence
  - minimum liquid candidate assets
  - overlap ceiling against existing themes
- In the same guarded mode, deterministic thresholds also gate:
  - feed candidate approval and activation through composite source scores
  - API source approval and activation with health/schema/ToS/rate-limit bonuses and diversity caps
  - candidate symbol auto-acceptance into the active universe through score, sector balance, and asset-kind balance
- Promoted themes are injected into the next replay cycle. They are not hot-patched into the currently running one.
- Auto-accepted candidate symbols trigger another replay pass so the next investment snapshot already reflects the expanded universe.

### Recommended operating mode

- `manual`: research only
- `guarded-auto`: default
- `full-auto`: only for aggressive experimentation

### Commands

```bash
npm run intelligence:scheduler:once
npm run intelligence:scheduler
node --import tsx scripts/intelligence-scheduler.mjs status
npm run intelligence:scheduler:service:install
```

### Pilot activation checklist

For the current repository default, the unattended pilot is almost ready out of the box.

What is already enabled:

- `coingecko-btc-core`
- `fred-core-cpi`
- `gdelt-middle-east`
- `acled-middle-east`

What you still need to supply:

- `FRED_API_KEY`
- `ACLED_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- optional LLM keys if you want remote summarization paths

Once the keys exist, the fastest bootstrap path is:

1. create `.env.local`
2. run `npm run intelligence:scheduler:service:install`
3. run `npm run intelligence:scheduler:status`
4. inspect `data/automation/logs`

## Recommended next operating step

Stand up a server-side pipeline that stores:

- raw_items
- normalized_events
- source_scores
- mapping_stats
- idea_runs
- forward_returns
- backtest_runs

Then run historical replay on past data before trusting the system's posterior scores for capital allocation.
